\begin{definition}[Even number]
An integer $n$ is \emph{even} if and only if it is divisible by 2.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Sum of two even numbers]
The sum of two even numbers is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof*}
Let $a$ and $b$ be even numbers. By definition, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n$. Then, the sum $a+b$ can be written as $a+b=2m+2n=2(m+n)$, which is clearly divisible by 2. Therefore, $a+b$ is even.
\end{proof*}

\begin{theorem}[Product of two even numbers]
The product of two even numbers is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof*}
Let $a$ and $b$ be even numbers. By definition, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n$. Then, the product $ab$ can be written as $ab=(2m)(2n)=4mn=2(2mn)$, which is clearly divisible by 2. Therefore, $ab$ is even.
\end{proof*}
